# Journal Filterer

## Requirements for a journal to be compatible

TODO

## Date format

In compatible journals, there are places where a date is required in the format:

`YY.MM.DD`

For example, the 18th of July 2020 would be formatted as `20.07.18`.

Dates in this format are used in two places:

- In the title of a journal entry in an entries file. For example:
    - `## 20.07.18 - Today is my birthday!`
- When specifying a date in a filter file. For example:
    - `"date_start": "20.07.18"`

Dates in other places do not have a required format.

## Suggested conventions

The following sections detail conventions that may make the experience of using
a compatible journal better. These conventions are not requirements for a
journal to be compatible.
